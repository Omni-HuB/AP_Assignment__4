/*                       _________ PROBLEM STATEMENT _________

An image is a matrix of pixels. You must have seen two types of images: color and grayscale.
A color image pixel hasthree colors: Red, Green, and Blue, but a grayscale image
pixel has only one color: Gray. Regardless of the image type, a color always has an 8-bit
integer value (0-255) associated with it. You need to implement a program that can input,
create, update and display the images (matrices). It should be able to compute their negatives
(matrices) as well. NOTE: You need to generalize the computation of negatives, for we only
need to subtract the color values from 255, regardless of the image type.
